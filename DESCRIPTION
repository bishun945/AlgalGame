Description: This packge is mainly the R version of the reaction-diffusion-taxis 
  model namely Algal Game which is originally proposed by Klausmeier and Litchman (2001).
  The model was designed based on two essential resources for phytoplanktons: light supplied
  from above and nutrients supplied from below (sediments). In this packge, the mode is 
  solved based on pacakges `deSolve`, `ReacTran`, and `rootSolve`. The plot functions are
  mainly based on `ggplot2`. The default parameters in this package were mainly refered from
  Klausmeier and Litchman (2002) and Zhou et al. (2019) *(in Chinese)*. This package is 
  personally for my PhD thesis but I think it is okay for other applications.
